Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender approaches are extensively investigated in research community and widely used in industry. They are based on the simple intuition that âˆ—Xin-Yu Dai is the corresponding author. This work was supported by the 863 program(2015AA015406) and the NSFC (61472183,61672277). 
if users rate items similarly in the past, they are likely to rate other items similarly in the future [Sarwar et al., 2001; Linden et al., 2003]. As the most popular approach among various collaborative filtering techniques, matrix factorization (MF) which learns a latent space to represent a user or an item becomes a standard model for recommendation due to its scalability, simplicity, and flexibility [Billsus and Pazzani, 1998;
Koren et al., 2009]. In the latent space, the recommender system predicts a personalized ranking over a set of items for each individual user with the similarities among the users and items.
